# esp-pbft — Implementation Roadmap

> **Status:** 🟡 Draft (v0.1)
> **Scope:** phased implementation plan with milestones, exit criteria, dependencies between phases, and staffing estimate.
> **Out of scope:** design → see other docs in `docs/`; API stability → [API-REFERENCE.md](./API-REFERENCE.md).

This document is the **canonical reference for the implementation plan**. It supersedes the high-level roadmap in HANDOVER §11.

---

## 1. Phasing strategy

esp-pbft is built in **5 phases over ~14 weeks**, with each phase producing a working, testable artefact. Phase gates are enforced — a phase cannot start until its predecessor's exit criteria are met.

| Phase | Duration | Deliverable | Exit gate |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **P1. Skeleton** | 2 weeks | compiles, single-node boots, no consensus | `idf.py build` succeeds; `pbft_init()` returns OK on devkit |
| **P2. Core consensus** | 3 weeks | 3-phase PBFT works on 7-node cluster, happy path only | Host-harness T2.H2 passes (1000 TXs committed, no forks) |
| **P3. Hardening** | 3 weeks | view-change, checkpoint, Y-5, retransmit | T4.C3 passes (14 TPS × 10 min, no view-changes); T4.C4 passes (reboot recovery) |
| **P4. Testing & docs** | 3 weeks | Byzantine tests pass, full docs published | T5.BF7 passes (safety under 6-of-7 Byzantine); all docs reviewed |
| **P5. Release** | 2 weeks | v1.0 tagged, examples working, deployment guide validated | Production cluster runs 24 h soak test |
| **P6. Post-v1** (optional) | TBD | API stabilises, RFC submitted | API frozen for 6 months |

Total: ~13 weeks to v1.0, plus optional P6.

---

## 2. Phase 1 — Skeleton (weeks 1-2)

### 2.1 Goal

Establish the build system, project structure, and minimal API surface. No PBFT logic yet.

### 2.2 Tasks

| # | Task | File(s) | Days |
|---|------|---------|------|
| 1.1 | Set up `idf_component.yml` with ESP-IDF v6.0.1 dependency | root | 0.5 |
| 1.2 | Create `Kconfig` with all options (default values) | `pbft/Kconfig` | 0.5 |
| 1.3 | Create `pbft_config.h` with constants + `_Static_assert` catalog | `include/pbft_config.h` | 1 |
| 1.4 | Stub `pbft_init`, `pbft_start`, `pbft_stop`, `pbft_deinit` (return `ESP_OK`) | `src/pbft.c` | 1 |
| 1.5 | Implement basic FreeRTOS task creation (no logic yet) | `src/pbft.c` | 1 |
| 1.6 | Wire up `idf.py build` for `esp32c3` target | root CMake | 0.5 |
| 1.7 | Configure example app to build + flash + monitor | `example/counter/` | 1 |
| 1.8 | Smoke test: app boots, prints "PBFT ready" | (test) | 0.5 |

### 2.3 Exit criteria

- [ ] `idf.py build` succeeds with zero warnings on `esp32c3` target
- [ ] `idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor` shows "PBFT ready" within 5 s
- [ ] `cppcheck` reports zero defects
- [ ] All `_Static_assert`s in `pbft_config.h` pass

### 2.4 Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| ESP-IDF v6.0.1 not installed | low | blocker | install from GitHub; document in README |
| Mbed TLS 4.0 PSA API differs from docs | medium | medium | validate against local install (`~/.espressif/v6.0.1/`) |

---

## 3. Phase 2 — Core consensus (weeks 3-5)

### 3.1 Goal

Implement the 3-phase PBFT protocol end-to-end on a 7-node cluster, in the happy path only (no failures).

### 3.2 Tasks

| 2.16 | Cluster smoke T4.C1, C2 | `tools/cluster_test/` | 2 |

### 3.3 Exit criteria

- [ ] T4.C2 passes (submission committed at all 7 within 200 ms)
- [ ] Average latency ≤ 50 ms (ESP-NOW)
- [ ] No memory leaks in 1-hour host-harness run

### 3.4 Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| ESP-NOW broadcast not received by all peers | high | blocker | add retransmit (B8); debug with sniffer |
| PSA key generation fails on first boot | low | blocker | check `psa_crypto_init` returned `PSA_SUCCESS`; add retry |
| `pbft_handle_commit` callback fires during crypto update (re-entrancy) | medium | medium | document thread-safety contract; use queue if needed |

---

## 4. Phase 3 — Hardening (weeks 6-8)

### 4.1 Goal

Add fault tolerance: view-change, checkpoint/GC, Y-5 re-gen, retransmit, dedup cache.

### 4.2 Tasks

| 3.17 | Cluster test T4.C3 (10 min sustained), C4 (power-cycle) | `tools/cluster_test/` | 2 |

### 4.3 Exit criteria

### 4.4 Risks

| View-change causes safety violation under specific timing | medium | catastrophic | extensive T5 Byzantine tests; replay-and-verify tool |
| Checkpoint GC frees entry that's still needed for O-set | low | catastrophic | gate GC on EXECUTED state only (CHECKPOINT.md §7.2) |
| Y-5 grace period misconfigured (messages still dropped) | medium | medium | extensive T2.H8 with simulated re-handshake failures |

---

## 6. Phase 5 — Release (weeks 12-13)

### 6.1 Goal

Tag v1.0, run final 24-hour soak test, publish release artifacts.

### 6.2 Tasks

| # | Task | Days |

| 5.6 | Announce on Espressif forum / ESP32 subreddit | 0.5 |
| 5.7 | Tag v1.0.0 in git | 0.1 |

### 6.3 Exit criteria

- [ ] CHANGELOG.md complete
- [ ] Component listed on `components.espressif.com`
- [ ] v1.0.0 tag pushed

---

## 7. Phase 6 — Post-v1 (optional)

### 7.1 Candidates

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Adaptive timeout** | medium | per-view value, +25% on timeout, -10% on commit |
| **TX batching** | high | 5-10× throughput improvement |
| **Persistent keys (PSA secure storage)** | medium | remove Y-5 grace period; faster recovery |
| **Multi-primary forwarding** (`pbft_submit_with_forward`) | medium | addresses audit A3 |
| **Adaptive view-change** | low | skip view-change if cluster obviously healthy |
| **BFT-SMaRt-style request ordering** | low | pipeline Prepare/Commit for higher throughput |
| **Multi-cluster federation** | low | requires cross-cluster PBFT (research) |
| **TLS for Hello (drop TOFU)** | high (security) | +50 ms handshake; drop audit B1 weakness |
| **Formal verification (TLA+ model)** | medium | proves safety properties |

### 7.2 Decision criteria

P6 features are taken up based on:
- User feedback (issues opened)
- Performance bottlenecks measured in production
- Security advisories

---

## 8. Staffing estimate

| Role | Effort | Where in timeline |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| Embedded C engineer (full-time) | 13 weeks | P1-P5 |
| Distributed systems engineer (part-time, 50%) | 13 weeks | P2-P5 (PBFT logic + tests) |
| DevOps / CI engineer (part-time, 25%) | 4 weeks | P4-P5 (CI gate + cluster test) |
| Technical writer (part-time, 25%) | 4 weeks | P4-P5 (docs) |
| Security reviewer (consultant) | 1 week | P5 (audit before release) |

**Total:** ~16 person-weeks over 13 calendar weeks.

---

## 9. Critical-path dependencies

```
P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5 → (P6)
```

| Phase | Depends on |
|-------|------------|
| P2 | P1 (need build + project structure) |
| P3 | P2 (need working consensus to break it with failures) |
| P4 | P3 (need all features to test them) |
| P5 | P4 (need green CI + tests to release) |

P2 and P3 cannot overlap (need stable P2 to test P3 fault tolerance). P4 can overlap with P5.

---

## 10. Open questions (roadmap level)

| # | Question | Recommendation |
|---|----------|----------------|
| R1 | When to add secure boot V2 as default? | P5, before release. |
| R2 | When to add flash encryption as default? | P5, before release. |
| R3 | When to drop TOFU (audit B1)? | P6 (v1.1), requires RSA-2048 HW on C3 (DS peripheral supports it; ~50 ms handshake cost). |
| R4 | Should we target esp32c6 / esp32h2 in addition to esp32c3? | v1.1 (those chips are newer; verify PSA API compatibility first). |
