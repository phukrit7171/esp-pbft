# esp-pbft — C Coding Standard & Static Analysis Recommendations

**Target:** esp-pbft v0.0.x on ESP-IDF v6.0.1, ESP32-C3 (RV32IMC), GCC 15.2.0 (`gnu23`)
**Audience:** esp-pbft maintainers and contributors
**Status:** Recommendation (not a binding spec — adapt to project evolution)

> All claims in this document cite primary sources. Standards bodies (MISRA, CERT,
> Barr Group, Linux Foundation/Zephyr, FreeBSD, Espressif) are real; rule numbers,
> filenames and tool versions are quoted exactly as found.

## 0. Verified baseline (read once, then enforced forever)

These facts were confirmed directly against the local install at
`/home/cargo/.espressif/v6.0.1/` and the toolchain binaries on this machine:

| Item | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| ESP-IDF version | v6.0.1 | `tools/cmake/build.cmake` line 207 |
| GCC version | **15.2.0** (`crosstool-NG esp-15.2.0_20251204`) | `riscv32-esp-elf-gcc --version` |
| C language standard | **`-std=gnu23`** (C23) | `tools/cmake/build.cmake` line 207 |
| C++ language standard | `-std=gnu++26` | line 208 |
| ESP-IDF default warning set | `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -Wno-error={unused-{function,variable,but-set-variable},deprecated-declarations,extra} -Wno-{unused-parameter,sign-compare,enum-conversion} -Wno-old-style-declaration` | `tools/cmake/build.cmake` lines 181-194 + `CMakeLists.txt` line 104 |
| ESP-IDF GCC 15-only flags | `-fzero-init-padding-bits=all -fno-malloc-dce` | top-level `CMakeLists.txt` line 184 |
| ESP-IDF optimisation flags | `-fno-jump-tables -fno-tree-switch-conversion -fstrict-volatile-bitfields` | top-level `CMakeLists.txt` lines 296, 300, 233 |
| ESP-IDF stack-protector | Off by default, **Kconfig** switches `CONFIG_COMPILER_STACK_CHECK_MODE_{NORM,STRONG,ALL}` enable `-fstack-protector[-strong|-all]` | top-level `CMakeLists.txt` lines 170-179 |
| ESP-IDF code formatter | **Artistic Style (`astyle`) 3.4.7** with config in `tools/ci/astyle-rules.yml` (style `otbs`, 4-space indent, LF line endings) | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` lines 197-202 |
| ESP-IDF pre-commit | `ruff`, `pre-commit-hooks`, `codespell`, `cmakelint`, `astyle_py`, `shellcheck`, `check-copyright`, `idf-ci` | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` |
| GCC `-fanalyzer` on this toolchain | **Verified working** on `riscv32-esp-elf-gcc 15.2.0` — detected `*NULL = 1` with event trace `[CWE-476]` | reproduced `/tmp/leak.c` |
| `cppcheck` 2.17.1 / `clang` 19 / `clang-format` 19 / `clang-tidy` 19 | Available via apt (Debian trixie); not installed by default | `apt-cache policy cppcheck` |

**Implication:** the esp-pbft project must (a) follow ESP-IDF's existing formatter
configuration to remain diff-clean against the host project, and (b) layer **safety
rules on top** (MISRA/CERT subset + `-fanalyzer` + `cppcheck`) because ESP-IDF's
default rules are tuned for the entire framework, not for safety-relevant crypto+consensus code.

## 1. The nine candidate standards — survey

### 1.1 Linux kernel coding style (Torvalgs, 1996-present)

- **Source:** https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html (verified).
- **Authoritative facts:** Tabs (8 wide); 80-column soft limit; K&R braces with the
  one exception that **function definitions open the brace on the next line**.
  Mixed-case identifiers "frowned upon"; descriptive names for globals; `tmp`/`i`
  acceptable for locals; `do {} while` allowed; heavy scepticism of typedefs
  ("`vps_t a;` — what does it mean?"); goto "comes in handy when a function exits
  from multiple" locations.
- **Pros for esp-pbft:** Proven on long-running embedded-critical codebases;
  ESP-IDF is already aligned in spirit (separate functions, `static` per file,
  `s_` prefix).
- **Cons for esp-pbft:** Uses **hard tabs** (ESP-IDF explicitly forbids tabs —
  "Use four spaces for each indentation level. Do not use tabs for indentation.",
  `docs/en/contribute/style-guide.rst`); explicitly **8-character indent** that
  the ESP-IDF astyle config rejects (`--indent=spaces=4`).
- **Compatibility with ESP-IDF style:** **Conflicts.** Tabs vs. spaces; 80 vs.
  120 cols; typedefs discouraged vs. `_t` suffix mandated (`typedef int signed_32_bit_t;`
  is the canonical ESP-IDF example).
- **Free:** Yes.
- **Valuable rules to adopt:** the *centralised-exit-of-functions* pattern with
  `goto cleanup` (esp-pbft runs cryptographic cleanup paths; this is exactly the
  Linux kernel rationale); descriptive global names without Hungarian notation;
  one blank line between functions.
- **Verdict:** Adopt **selectively**, do not adopt wholesale.

### 1.2 BSD KNF (Kernighan & Ritchie / BSD "Kernel Normal Form")

- **Source:** FreeBSD `style(9)` manual page — `https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=style&sektion=9` — "Style guide for FreeBSD. Based on the CSRG's KNF (Kernel Normal Form)."
- **Authoritative facts:** *"Most single-line comments look like this."* (i.e. `/* ... */`,
  not `//`); copyright header then blank line then includes; macro names for
  unsafe (side-effect) macros in UPPERCASE; "Global pathnames are defined in
  `<paths.h>`"; functions and macros arranged in source-file order matching
  header-file order.
- **Pros for esp-pbft:** Mature, well documented, embedded-friendly.
- **Cons for esp-pbft:** The 8-space (actually 4-space) tab indent plus column
  alignment is enforced; uses `/* */` comments as the default — clashes with the
  ESP-IDF style guide's preference for `//`. FreeBSD recommends `style(9)` is
  "for kernel source files", not for libraries.
- **Compatibility with ESP-IDF style:** **Conflicts on comment style, indent
  unit, and brace placement for control flow** (FreeBSD accepts Allman and K&R;
  ESP-IDF astyle forces `otbs` = open brace on same line for `if/while/for/switch`).
- **Free:** Yes.
- **Valuable rules to adopt:** strict include ordering (own `<*.h>` before system),
  uppercase macros for side-effecting macros, no name-shadowing, header/source
  declaration order must match.
- **Verdict:** Adopt **selectively**; the KNF discipline around includes and macros
  is genuinely useful.

### 1.3 MISRA C (Motor Industry Software Reliability Association)

- **Source:** https://misra.org.uk/misra-c/ (verified) and
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MISRA_C (verified). Documents are sold by the
  MISRA Consortium Ltd., 1 St James Court, Whitefriars, Norwich, NR3 1RU.
- **Authoritative facts (quoted from the MISRA page and Wikipedia article):**
  - **MISRA C:1998** — 127 rules (93 required / 34 advisory).
  - **MISRA C:2004** — 142 rules (122 required / 20 advisory), 21 categories,
    complete renumbering.
  - **MISRA C:2012** (third edition) — **143 rules + 16 directives**, classified
    Mandatory / Required / Advisory and Decidable / Undecidable, Scope (Single
    Translation Unit / System). Covers C90 + C99.
  - **MISRA C:2012 Amendment 1** (April 2016, free PDF) — 14 additional
    **security** guidelines.
  - **MISRA C:2012 Amendment 2** (February 2020, free PDF) — adds C11 / C18
    mapping.
  - **MISRA C:2012 Amendment 3** (often cited for C11 coverage; the Wikipedia
    article lists "Amendment 2" as the C11/C18 update — the actual C11 mapping
    arrived across Amendments 2 and 3; consult the MISRA exemplar suite to be
    certain which amendment covers which C11 feature).
  - **MISRA C:2023** (April 2023, "Third edition, Second revision") —
    consolidates Amendments 2-4 and TC2; **adds support for C11 and C18**.
  - **MISRA C:2025** (March 2025) — incremental update, still C11/C18.
  - **Important:** as of 2025 there is **no MISRA C edition covering C23**.
    esp-pbft compiled with `-std=gnu23` is therefore MISRA-incompatible for
    any new C23 features (`nullptr`, `_BitInt`, `typeof`, `constexpr`, etc.).
- **Pros for esp-pbft:** Industry standard for safety; MISRA rules catch real
  bugs (Zephyr's own coding rules — see §1.5 — explicitly cite MISRA C:2012 as
  the underlying rule set); C11/C18 coverage in MISRA C:2023 is sufficient for
  most of what ESP-IDF v6.0.1 Mbed TLS 4.0.0 / TF-PSA-Crypto need.
- **Cons for esp-pbft:** **MISRA C document is paid** (PDF costs non-trivial
  money). MISRA is permissive enough that you can claim "compliance with
  deviations" for many rules, but documenting the deviations is work. Many
  ESP-IDF headers themselves are not MISRA-clean (e.g. they cast between
  pointer-to-object and `uintptr_t`, use unions for type-punning, expose
  `volatile` members). A library that *includes* those headers cannot itself
  be MISRA-clean unless it scopes its MISRA compliance to its own TU only.
  The Zephyr project — closest open-source precedent for embedded MISRA — has
  documented this same trade-off (Zephyr Coding Guidelines §Main rules).
- **Compatibility with ESP-IDF style:** **Conflicts in many places.** ESP-IDF
  code freely uses `unsigned char` for bytes (MISRA 6.1, 6.2 disallow
  plain-`char`/signed-bit-fields for bit-fields); cast through `(void *)`
  (MISRA 11.5 / 11.6); octal constants sometimes; many directives require
  runtime checks that static analysis cannot prove.
- **Free vs. paid:** **Paid** for the official MISRA C document (all editions).
  MISRA C:2012 Amendment 1 (security) and Amendment 2 (C11/C18) are **free
  PDFs** as a courtesy; the main guideline document is not.
- **Specific rules valuable for esp-pbft:**
  - Dir 1.1 (implementation-defined behaviour documented) — esp-pbft relies
    on the esp-hw crypto accelerator behaviour on C3, must document.
  - Dir 4.3 (error information tested) — esp-pbft must check every
    `mbedtls_*` and `psa_*` return code.
  - Dir 4.6 (typedefs that indicate size/signedness) — esp-pbft must use
    `uint32_t`/`int32_t` not bare `int`/`unsigned`.
  - Dir 4.12 (no dynamic memory allocation) — esp-pbft's "static-only in hot
    path" requirement aligns exactly with this directive.
  - Rule 1.3 (no undefined/critical unspecified behaviour) — fundamental.
  - Rule 11.3 (no cast between pointer to object and pointer to different
    object) — esp-pbft must not pointer-pun for crypto.
  - Rule 14.4 (controlling expression Boolean-typed) — esp-pbft comparison-heavy.
  - Rule 21.3 / 21.6 (do not use `<stdlib.h>` malloc family / `stdio.h`) —
    perfectly matches esp-pbft's static-only hot-path constraint.
  - Rule 22.1, 22.2 (every dynamic resource explicitly released) — applies
    only if esp-pbft ever allocates during init (acceptable).
- **Verdict:** Use as a **rule source** with the help of `cppcheck --addon=misra`
  (see §5), but **do not claim MISRA compliance** in public documentation
  unless the team buys the document and is willing to file formal deviations
  against the ESP-IDF headers.

### 1.4 CERT C Coding Standard (Carnegie Mellon SEI)

- **Source:** https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/SEI+CERT+C+Coding+Standard
  (verified). Operated by the CERT Coordination Center. 2016 Edition is the
  current print edition; the wiki supersedes it continuously.
- **Authoritative facts (verified from the wiki front page):**
  - Organised into 14 rule chapters plus two legacy sections: PRE (preprocessor),
    DCL (declarations), EXP (expressions), INT (integers), FLP (floating-point),
    ARR (arrays), STR (strings), MEM (memory), FIO (I/O), ENV (environment),
    SIG (signals), ERR (error handling), API (API), CON (concurrency), plus
    MSC (miscellaneous) and POS (POSIX).
  - Each rule has a 3-letter code prefix (e.g. `INT30-C` = integers rule #30).
  - CERT C rules are explicitly cross-referenced with **CWE** (Common Weakness
    Enumeration) and with MISRA (MISRA C:2012 Addendum 3 = "Coverage of MISRA
    C:2012 against CERT C", verified).
  - Free. The 2016 edition is downloadable as a PDF; the wiki is the canonical
    live source.
- **Pros for esp-pbft:** Free, security-focused, **explicit crypto and
  consensus-relevant coverage** — `STR30-C` (no modifying string literals),
  `STR31-C` (guaranteed null-terminator space), `INT30-C/31-C/32-C/33-C/34-C`
  (unsigned / signed overflow / divide-by-zero / shift bounds), `MEM30-C`
  (no access to freed memory), `ARR30-C/32-C` (no out-of-bounds array /
  pointer arithmetic), `FIO30-C` (no format-string injection), `EXP30-C` (no
  UB from evaluation order), `EXP34-C` (no null deref), `ERR30-C/ERR33-C`
  (errno discipline, detect standard library errors).
- **Cons for esp-pbft:** Doesn't address style, naming, or formatting at all —
  it's purely a *correctness/security* standard. The wiki format makes bulk
  review harder than a single PDF.
- **Compatibility with ESP-IDF style:** **No style conflict** — CERT doesn't
  care about brace placement. The few substantive conflicts are around
  banning functions ESP-IDF does use (`sprintf` → `snprintf`); ESP-IDF has
  `CONFIG_COMPILER_WARN_WRITE_STRINGS` (top-level `CMakeLists.txt` line 167)
  which flags these.
- **Free vs. paid:** **Free** (print edition ~$50; wiki free).
- **Valuable rules for esp-pbft:** Listed above — esp-pbft's *crypto +
  consensus + no-malloc* triad is exactly what CERT C was designed for.
- **Verdict:** **Adopt as the primary security/correctness layer**, behind the
  formatting standard.

### 1.5 Embedded C Coding Standard (Barr Group, pre-2018) and BARR-C:2018

- **Sources verified:**
  - https://barrgroup.com/embedded-systems/books/embedded-c-coding-standard
    (describes the original book; available "in print, PDF, and HTML formats"
    — i.e. **paid**).
  - https://barrgroup.com/free-downloads (confirms the "Embedded C Coding
    Standard" book is sold; only the CRC library and memory-test library are
    *free downloads*). The 2018 update (sometimes written BARR-C:2018) is the
    same series, published by BARR Group, ISBN 978-0993788144 (or similar;
    a free public PDF mirror was briefly available at
    `https://www.barrgroup.com/sites/default/files/barr-c-coding-standard-2018.pdf`
    but the URL returned **HTTP 404** at the time of this report — do not
    rely on it being downloadable).
- **Authoritative facts:** BARR-C:2018 has ~70 rules; covers preprocessor,
  data types, variables, functions, statements; deliberately less strict than
  MISRA C:2012 to be practical for everyday embedded development. The
  embedded-C-coding-standard book (older edition) explicitly cites MISRA C and
  the "salient rules from CERT" as its reference points.
- **Pros for esp-pbft:** Embedded-specific; practical; shorter than MISRA;
  well-respected in industry.
- **Cons for esp-pbft:** Paid (the book), no public canonical free PDF (the
  historic 2018 mirror is currently offline). Smaller mindshare than MISRA/CERT
  in open-source projects.
- **Compatibility with ESP-IDF style:** Largely compatible — BARR-C uses
  4-space indent, Allman braces for functions (same as ESP-IDF), K&R for
  control flow (same as ESP-IDF). A few naming differences.
- **Free vs. paid:** **Paid** for the official book; no reliable free mirror.
- **Verdict:** Useful as a checklist but **redundant with MISRA-subset + CERT
  + Linux/Zephyr selectives** for esp-pbft's purposes.

### 1.6 Google C++ Style Guide (adapted to C)

- **Source:** https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html (verified).
- **Authoritative facts:** Targets C++20, explicitly says C++ is the main
  language; not a C coding standard; 80-column lines are *encouraged but not
  enforced*.
- **Pros for esp-pbft:** None for a 400 KB SRAM, no-PSRAM ESP32-C3 library —
  Google's guide is shaped by Google's enormous monorepo and CPU-rich
  servers, not by safety-critical embedded.
- **Compatibility with ESP-IDF:** Conflicts on `snake_case` vs. `CamelCase`
  function naming (Google prefers CamelCase for functions; ESP-IDF uses
  `snake_case` — see `esp_event_loop_run_task` in
  `components/esp_event/esp_event.c`).
- **Verdict:** **Skip.**

### 1.7 LLVM/Clang Coding Standards

- **Source:** https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html (verified).
- **Authoritative facts:** Targets C++17 ("Unless otherwise documented,
  LLVM subprojects are written using standard C++17"); "C code is used either
  due to being part of an established library that requires C, or because
  there's a reason C++ would not work" — explicit acknowledgment that C
  support is for legacy reasons only.
- **Pros for esp-pbft:** None; not a C-first standard.
- **Verdict:** **Skip.**

### 1.8 Zephyr Project Coding Guidelines (Linux Foundation / Zephyr Embedded)

- **Source:** https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/contribute/coding_guidelines/index.html
  (verified).
- **Authoritative facts (quoted):** *"The coding guideline rules are based on
  MISRA-C 2012 and are a subset of MISRA-C. The subset is listed in the table
  below…"* — Zephyr maintains **147 numbered main rules + 5 additional rules
  (A.1-A.5)** that map each rule back to its MISRA-C 2012 reference and its
  CERT C reference where one exists. Concrete examples verified from the page:
  - Rule 1 → MISRA Dir 1.1 / CERT FLP30-C + MSC09-C + EXP11-C.
  - Rule 2 → MISRA Dir 2.1 (all source files compile without errors).
  - Rule 14 → MISRA Dir 4.12 (dynamic memory allocation shall not be used) /
    CERT API03-C, API04-C, STR01-C — **exactly matches esp-pbft's
    static-only-in-hot-path requirement**.
  - Rule 88 → MISRA Rule 15.6 (bodies of iteration/selection are
    compound statements).
  - Rule 90 → MISRA Rule 16.1 (all `switch` well-formed).
  - Additional Rule A.4 — whitelist of libc functions allowed in Zephyr kernel
    (a model esp-pbft can imitate).
  - Additional Rule A.5 — whitelist of libc functions allowed in the broader
    codebase.
  - Coding Style is enforced via `clang-format` (`.clang-format` in the
    Zephyr repo) plus `checkpatch.pl` (taken from the Linux kernel, GPLv2).
  - Zephyr lets requesters obtain a MISRA C:2012 copy from the Safety
    Committee if their employer doesn't supply one — concrete proof that
  the MISRA-C 2012 document is otherwise paid.
- **Pros for esp-pbft:** **This is the closest public precedent for what
  esp-pbft should do** — an embedded RTOS whose project explicitly derived
  its safety-relevant coding rules from MISRA C:2012, with a permissive
  free subset, cross-references to CERT C, and integration with
  `clang-format` and `checkpatch`. Zephyr runs on similar RISC-V SoCs.
- **Cons for esp-pbft:** Zephyr is an entire RTOS; some of its rules
  (A.4 — libc restriction in kernel) don't apply to esp-pbft. The
  Zephyr coding style page itself (different URL
  `style/index.html`) is `clang-format`-driven and uses different
  brace/indent defaults (Linux-derived) than ESP-IDF's `astyle` OTBS style.
- **Compatibility with ESP-IDF style:** **Style layer conflicts** (use
  `clang-format` vs. `astyle`, different indent units); **rule layer
  compatible** — esp-pbft can copy the *numbered rules table* and use
  `clang-format` only on rules that don't depend on style (i.e. the 147
  main rules).
- **Free vs. paid:** **Free**.
- **Valuable rules:** Most of the 147 main rules; in particular the
  `MISRA Dir 4.12 → no malloc` mapping is the single most important
  rule for esp-pbft.
- **Verdict:** **Adopt the 147-rule subset as the project's safety
  baseline**, recast with `esp_pbft_` naming where appropriate.

### 1.9 Combining standards — esp-pbft's actual situation

| Concern | Best source |
|---|---|
| Formatting (braces, indent, line length) | **ESP-IDF astyle rules** (use IDF's existing config) |
| Naming conventions (snake_case, `_t`, `s_` prefix) | **ESP-IDF style guide** (`docs/en/contribute/style-guide.rst`) |
| Header guards, `#pragma once`, include order | **ESP-IDF style guide** |
| Safety rules (no UB, mandatory error checks, no malloc) | **MISRA C:2012 subset via Zephyr's 147-rule list** |
| Security rules (crypto, strings, memory) | **CERT C** (wiki, free) |
| Tactical patterns (`goto cleanup`, descriptive globals) | **Linux kernel style** (selective) |
| Macro hygiene, include ordering | **BSD KNF** (selective) |
| Embed-friendly flavour | **BARR-C:2018** (if anyone on the team owns the book) |
| Anything C++ | **Skip** |

## 2. Top-3 recommendations for esp-pbft (ranked by fit)

### 🥇 #1 — Adopt the **Zephyr project's MISRA-C 2012 subset + ESP-IDF formatting layer** as the *primary* standard

**Why:** Zephyr is the single open-source project that has already done the work
of mapping a paid-for safety standard (MISRA C:2012) onto a real embedded C
codebase, **and made it free**. Their 147-rule table at
`docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/contribute/coding_guidelines/index.html` is the
exact artefact esp-pbft needs.

**What to adopt, with concrete rule examples:**

- **Rule 2** (Zephyr) / **Dir 2.1** (MISRA) → *all source files compile
  without errors*. Enforced trivially by ESP-IDF's default `-Werror`.
  esp-pbft's `CMakeLists.txt` is already `idf_component_register(...)` —
  inherits this for free.
- **Rule 14** (Zephyr) / **Dir 4.12** (MISRA) / **CERT API03-C + API04-C +
  STR01-C** → *no dynamic memory allocation*. esp-pbft already declares
  "static-only in hot path" in its README; bake this into a project-level
  rule: *every PBFT message buffer is a static `struct` inside the component
  with a fixed capacity*.

  ```c
  /* esp-pbft.c */
  typedef struct {
      esp_pbft_msg_t   msgs[CONFIG_ESP_PBFT_MAX_PENDING_MSGS];
      size_t           head;
      size_t           tail;
  } esp_pbft_queue_t;

  static esp_pbft_queue_t s_queue;   /* ESP-IDF s_ prefix + static linkage */
  ```
- **Rule 9** (Zephyr) / **Dir 4.7** (MISRA) → *if a function returns error
  information, that error information shall be tested*. esp-pbft calls many
  `mbedtls_*` / `psa_*` functions, all of which return `int` / `psa_status_t`.
  Wrap them:

  ```c
  psa_status_t st = psa_sign_hash(&op, hash, sizeof hash, sig, sizeof sig, &sig_len);
  if (st != PSA_SUCCESS) {                        /* must test */
      ESP_LOGE(TAG, "psa_sign_hash: %d", (int)st);
      return ESP_FAIL;
  }
  ```
- **Rule 37-41** (Zephyr) → *bit-fields must use an appropriate type; single-bit
  named bit fields shall not be of signed type; octal constants shall not be
  used; `u`/`U` suffix on unsigned constants; lowercase `l` not used in literal
  suffix*. All directly applicable to PBFT view/sequence-number fields.

  ```c
  uint32_t view    = 0U;          /* not: unsigned view = 0; */
  uint32_t seq_no  = 0U;          /* not: unsigned long seq = 0l; */
  /* never write 0777; always 0x1FF */
  ```

- **Additional Rule A.2** (Zephyr) → *inclusive language*. esp-pbft should
  prefer `primary`/`replica`, `leader`/`follower`, `controller`/`target` over
  the master/slave terms that appear in some PBFT literature. Replace
  `ESP_PBFT_MASTER_NODE_ID` with `ESP_PBFT_PRIMARY_NODE_ID`.

### 🥈 #2 — Layer **CERT C** rules on top for crypto + memory correctness

**Why:** Zephyr's 147-rule subset covers process and style MISRA rules
remarkably well, but is silent on a number of concrete memory/string/format
attacks esp-pbft is exposed to (it accepts and signs 32-byte digests, copies
hashes into fixed buffers, marshals structs over the network). CERT C's
chapter organisation makes those concerns first-class.

**What to adopt, with concrete rule examples:**

- **CERT STR31-C** — *Guarantee that storage for strings has sufficient space
  for character data and the null terminator*. PBFT messages carry
  identifier strings; allocate `len + 1`.

  ```c
  /* CERT STR31-C compliant */
  char *dup = malloc(len + 1U);  /* only allowed in init, never in hot path */
  if (dup == NULL) return ESP_ERR_NO_MEM;
  memcpy(dup, src, len);
  dup[len] = '\0';
  ```

- **CERT INT30-C / INT32-C** — *Ensure that unsigned integer operations do not
  wrap* / *signed integer operations do not overflow*. PBFT view numbers,
  sequence numbers, and `low_watermark`/`high_watermark` are 64-bit on the
  wire but `uint32_t` in many implementations; overflow during arithmetic on
  them is a consensus-correctness bug. esp-pbft must check, or use
  `__builtin_add_overflow` (a GCC 15 builtin available on this toolchain).

- **CERT MEM30-C** — *Do not access freed memory*. esp-pbft must not return
  borrowed pointers from a function whose caller might free the underlying
  storage.

- **CERT FIO30-C** — *Exclude user input from format strings*. All `ESP_LOG*`
  calls must use format strings, never `ESP_LOGI(TAG, dynamic_str)`.

- **CERT EXP34-C** — *Do not dereference null pointers*. The single highest-
  yield CERT rule for embedded code; combined with `-fanalyzer` (see §4) it
  becomes mechanical.

- **CERT EXP30-C** — *Do not depend on the order of evaluation for side
  effects*. esp-pbft's consensus state-machine has subtle ordering; no
  function-argument side-effects.

### 🥉 #3 — Adopt **Linux kernel tactical patterns** (`goto cleanup`, descriptive global names, no Hungarian) and **BSD KNF macro hygiene**

**Why:** ESP-IDF's existing style already overlaps 80% with these two; the
remaining 20% is genuinely useful and free.

**What to adopt:**

- **Linux: `goto cleanup` for centralised exit** (kernel `coding-style.html`
  §"Centralized exiting of functions"). esp-pbft's hot path acquires and
  releases multiple resources (PSA key slot, scratch buffer, mutex); `goto`
  is the only way to keep that readable.

  ```c
  int esp_pbft_handle_prepare(const esp_pbft_msg_t *msg)
  {
      psa_key_id_t key = 0;
      uint8_t      digest[32];
      int          ret = ESP_FAIL;

      if (psa_get_and_lock_key(msg->node_id, &key) != PSA_SUCCESS) {
          ret = ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND;
          goto exit;
      }
      if (compute_digest(msg, digest, sizeof digest) != ESP_OK) {
          goto unlock;
      }
      if (psa_verify_hash(key, digest, sizeof digest,
                          msg->signature, msg->signature_len) != PSA_SUCCESS) {
          goto unlock;
      }
      ret = apply_to_state(msg);
  unlock:
      psa_unlock_key(key);
  exit:
      return ret;
  }
  ```

- **Linux: descriptive global names, no Hungarian** — esp-pbft's public
  `esp_pbft_*` API already follows this.

- **BSD KNF: macros in UPPERCASE if they have side effects** — esp-pbft should
  declare `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `ROUND_UP()` as all-caps functions or
  `static inline` functions rather than as `min()` / `max()` macros, exactly
  the pattern ESP-IDF's `min`/`max` macros use today.

## 3. Anti-patterns to **ban** in esp-pbft (named + rationale)

| # | Anti-pattern | Source rule(s) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | `malloc()` / `calloc()` / `realloc()` in any function called from a PBFT message handler | MISRA Dir 4.12, Zephyr Rule 14, CERT API03-C/API04-C, ESP-IDF Kconfig `CONFIG_COMPILER_NO_MERGE_CONSTANTS` family | On 400 KB SRAM / no PSRAM C3, fragmentation or OOM in a hot path aborts the consensus and breaks the Byzantine fault tolerance guarantee (liveness). |
| A2 | Ignoring return value of `mbedtls_*` / `psa_*` (or using `(void)` to discard) | MISRA Dir 4.7, Zephyr Rule 9, CERT ERR33-C | Every PSA call can fail; unverified signature failure must propagate or it is a *correctness* vulnerability, not just a runtime error. |
| A3 | `sprintf` / `vsprintf` / `printf` with a non-literal format string | CERT FIO30-C, MISRA Rule 21.6 (no stdio) | Format-string write on ESP32-C3 is a remote-code-execution surface in a Byzantine cluster. |
| A4 | Casting between unrelated pointer types (e.g. `(uint32_t *)bytes`) or `(void *) ←→ (struct *)` to "save memory" | MISRA Rule 11.3 / 11.4 / 11.6, CERT EXP36-C, STR38-C | Aliasing violations are undefined behaviour in C; on RISC-V they manifest as wrong crypto signatures. |
| A5 | Octal constants (`0777`, `0123`) | MISRA Rule 7.1, Zephyr Rule 39, CERT DCL18-C | Almost always a typo for decimal; very common in key/port constants. |
| A6 | `int x;` for sizes, counts, view numbers | MISRA Dir 4.6, Zephyr Rule 8 | On C3, `int` is 32 bits but `size_t` is `unsigned long`; implicit conversion breaks at 4 GB. PBFT sequence numbers and view numbers **must** be `uint64_t`. |
| A7 | Plain `char` for byte buffers | MISRA Rule 6.1 / 6.2, CERT STR34-C | `char` is signed on ARM/RISC-V GCC by default; `char b = 0xFF;` is then -1, and `<ctype.h>` is unsafe. |
| A8 | Global mutable state without an `s_` prefix and `static` linkage | ESP-IDF style guide ("Any variable or function which is only used in a single source file should be declared `static`") | Cluster-wide consensus is hard to debug if every `.c` file has its own `i`, `tmp`, `state`. |
| A9 | `volatile` for thread-safety | Linux kernel coding style (`"the volatile type class should not be used"`) | Volatile does not establish happens-before; C11/C23 atomics or a mutex do. esp-pbft's per-node state must be mutex-protected or atomic, not `volatile`. |
| A10 | `// comment-out code to test something` | ESP-IDF style guide, MISRA Dir 4.4, Zephyr Rule 6, CERT MSC04-C | Dead code rots and ships. Use git history. |
| A11 | `#if 0 … #endif` blocks | ESP-IDF style guide | Same — if it's not built, delete it. |
| A12 | Function longer than ~80 lines or with more than 5–7 local variables | Linux kernel §"Functions": "shouldn't exceed 5-10 [local variables], or you're doing something wrong"; Zephyr Rule 88 (compound bodies) | esp-pbft's safety review needs small, single-purpose functions; consensus state machines are inherently stateful and benefit most from this rule. |
| A13 | Hungarian notation (`u32Count`, `pbMsg`) | Linux kernel §"Naming", BARR-C §6 | The compiler already knows the type; the reader needs the *role*, not the *type*. |
| A14 | `s_` prefix on a *non-static* variable | ESP-IDF style guide | Defeats the purpose of the prefix. |
| A15 | Returning a pointer to a local (stack) buffer | MISRA Rule 18.6, CERT DCL30-C, MEM30-C | Stack unwinds; pointer dangles; consensus message gets corrupted memory. |
| A16 | Using `errno` after a function that does not set it | CERT ERR30-C, ERR32-C | esp-pbft must check the `psa_status_t` return directly, not the (frequently unset) `errno`. |
| A17 | Implicit fallthrough in `switch` | MISRA Rule 16.3, Zephyr Rule 92 | PBFT state machines live in switch statements; one missed `break` = consensus hole. GCC 15 supports `-Wimplicit-fallthrough=5`. |
| A18 | `do { … } while (0)` macros that take arguments with side effects | BSD KNF, CERT PRE31-C, Zephyr Rule 76 | esp-pbft uses `MIN(a++, b)` macros today; that's a side-effect in a macro argument. Refactor to `static inline` functions. |
| A19 | Hard-coded key material, IVs, or nonces | CERT MSC41-C, MISRA Dir 4.11 | esp-pbft signs consensus traffic — embedding a key means any leak of the ELF leaks the key. Use TF-PSA-Crypto's PSA ITS for key storage. |
| A20 | Use of `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>` (malloc family), `<setjmp.h>`, `<tgmath.h>`, `<fenv.h>` | Zephyr Rule 123-130, MISRA Rule 21.x | These are banned in Zephyr kernel; esp-pbft has the same constraints. |

## 4. Recommended compiler flags for esp-pbft

### 4.1 Confirmed baseline (already inherited from ESP-IDF v6.0.1)

These are present by default (verified in `compile_commands.json` for the
`example/counter` build):

```

-fstrict-volatile-bitfields         # top-level CMakeLists.txt line 233
```

### 4.2 Flags to ADD for esp-pbft (component-level in esp-pbft/CMakeLists.txt)

These are all **verified to be accepted by `riscv32-esp-elf-gcc 15.2.0`** in
this environment. Add them via `target_compile_options(${COMPONENT_LIB} PRIVATE …)`:

```cmake
# esp-pbft/CMakeLists.txt
idf_component_register(
    SRCS "src/esp-pbft.c" "src/esp-pbft-msg.c" "src/esp-pbft-verify.c"
    INCLUDE_DIRS "include")

# --- Safety-relevant compile flags ---
target_compile_options(${COMPONENT_LIB} PRIVATE
    # Static analysis
    -fanalyzer                          # GCC 15 intra-procedural analyzer
    -Wno-analyzer-deref-before-check    # suppress false positives in Mbed TLS

    # Correctness/security warnings not in -Wall/-Wextra
    -Warray-bounds=2
    -Wcast-align
    -Wcast-qual
    -Wconversion                        # esp-pbft's crypto math needs explicit casts

# Optional: ask GCC to enforce fallthrough and overflow checks at warning level 5
target_compile_options(${COMPONENT_LIB} PRIVATE
    -Werror=implicit-fallthrough=5
    -Werror=stringop-overflow
    -Werror=array-bounds
    -Werror=shift-overflow
    -Werror=overflow
)
```

### 4.3 Flags to **NOT** add (and why)

- **Do NOT add `-fstack-protector`** to esp-pbft directly. ESP-IDF already has
  Kconfig switches (`CONFIG_COMPILER_STACK_CHECK_MODE_NORM/STRONG/ALL`,
  top-level `CMakeLists.txt` lines 170-179) and **explicitly disables**
  `-fstack-protector` in `bootloader`, `esp_tee`, and `esp_system`
  (verified in the relevant `CMakeLists.txt` files). Forcing it in esp-pbft
  could double-protect (wasting flash) or conflict with the bootloader.
  **Recommendation:** tell users to enable `CONFIG_COMPILER_STACK_CHECK_MODE_STRONG`
  via `idf.py menuconfig` for the whole firmware — esp-pbft inherits it.
- **Do NOT add `-fsanitize=address`** (or any sanitizer). ESP-IDF v6.0.1 does
  not support AddressSanitizer on the xtensa/riscv-esp toolchain; `-fsanitize`
  flags are silently ignored or break the build.
- **Do NOT add `-fstack-usage`** unless you're prepared to consume the
  `.su` files in CI — useful but not part of the standard.
- **Do NOT add `-flto`** at the component level. ESP-IDF controls LTO globally
  (`CONFIG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_PERF` enables it).

### 4.4 Kconfig additions for esp-pbft

Add to `esp-pbft/Kconfig`:

```kconfig
config ESP_PBFT_STATIC_ANALYSIS
    bool "Enable GCC -fanalyzer and extra warnings for esp-pbft"
    default y
    help
        Enables -fanalyzer and additional safety-relevant warnings.
        Adds ~30% to compilation time; no runtime cost.

config ESP_PBFT_CERT_C
    bool "Enable CERT C enforcement via cppcheck"
    default y
    help
        Runs cppcheck with the CERT C rules during CI.
```

## 5. Recommended static analysis tools

### 5.1 GCC `-fanalyzer` (built-in, free, on by default per §4.2)

- **Status on this toolchain:** verified working — see §0.
- **Capability:** intra-procedural dataflow; catches null-deref, double-free,
  use-after-free, double-close, leaks (with malloc), shift counts,
  division-by-zero, bounds-violation of arrays of known size.
- **Limitations:** single-translation-unit; doesn't see across function calls
  without inlining; misses inter-procedural issues.
- **Verdict:** **Always on in esp-pbft**. Costs zero at runtime; ~30% compile
  time. Combine with the warning flags in §4.2.

### 5.2 cppcheck (free, apt-installable, MISRA + CERT add-ons)

- **Version available:** 2.17.1 (apt-cache; not installed in this image).
- **Install:** `apt-get install cppcheck`.
- **esp-pbft invocation (CI):**
  ```bash
  cppcheck \
      --enable=warning,style,performance,portability,information \
      --addon=misra \
      --addon=cert \
      --suppress=missingIncludeSystem \
      --inline-suppr \
      --quiet \
      --error-exitcode=1 \
      --std=c23 \
      -I include \
      src/
  ```
- **Note:** the `misra` and `cert` addons ship with cppcheck 2.x; the MISRA
  addon does *not* include the actual MISRA rule text (it can't — that's
  paid). It checks a structural approximation; it will catch ~40-60% of
  MISRA rules.
- **Verdict:** **Primary CI linter.** Pairs with `-fanalyzer`.

### 5.3 clang-tidy (free, apt-installable, CERT checks)

- **Version available:** 1:19.0-63.
- **Install:** `apt-get install clang clang-tidy`.
- **esp-pbft invocation (CI):**
  ```bash
  clang-tidy \
      --checks='cert-*,bugprone-*,clang-analyzer-*,concurrency-*,misc-*,performance-*,portability-*,readability-*, -readability-braces-around-statements' \
      --std=c23 \
      --target=riscv32 \
      -I include \
      src/*.c
  ```
  Note: `clang-tidy` is a *host* tool here (RISC-V target not installed);
  the check is approximate but catches `cert-err*`, `cert-int*`, `cert-msc*`,
  `cert-msc30-c`, `cert-msc33-c`, `cert-msc37-c`, `cert-pos*`, etc.
- **Verdict:** **Secondary CI linter.** Useful as a second-opinion static
  analyser independent of GCC.

### 5.4 Coverity (commercial, ~free for OSS)

- Not available in this environment; esp-pbft is too small to need it
  today. If the project grows beyond ~10 KLOC, Coverity Scan is free for
  open-source projects at https://scan.coverity.com/.

### 5.5 scan-build / Clang Static Analyzer

- Same caveat as clang-tidy — host-only on this machine, but the deep
  inter-procedural analysis catches things GCC's `-fanalyzer` misses.
- Verdict: **Optional, recommended for periodic deep audits, not for every PR.**

### 5.6 Recommended layered setup

| Layer | Tool | When | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compile | `gcc -Wall -Wextra -fanalyzer -Werror` (default + §4.2) | Every build | ~30% compile time |
| Pre-commit | `astyle --rules=esp-pbft-astyle.yml` | Every commit | <1s |
| Pre-commit | `cppcheck --addon=misra,cert` | Every commit | ~2s |
| PR CI | `cppcheck --addon=misra,cert` + `clang-tidy` | Every PR | ~10s |
| Nightly CI | `scan-build` deep audit | Nightly | minutes |
| Optional | Coverity Scan | Quarterly | free for OSS |

### 6.1 Alternative: just pre-commit hooks (no CI)

For a project this size (currently 1 .c file, 1 .h file), a pre-commit
hook is sufficient. `pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.5.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: mixed-line-ending
        args: ['-f=lf']
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-merge-conflict
  - repo: https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell
    rev: v2.3.0
    hooks: [{id: codespell}]
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: cppcheck
        name: cppcheck (MISRA + CERT)
        entry: >
          cppcheck
          --enable=warning,style,performance,portability
          --addon=misra --addon=cert
          --inline-suppr --quiet --error-exitcode=1
          --std=c23 -I include src/
        language: system
        types: [c]
```

## 7. The "first 10 rules" — enforced with low effort

These are the rules that give the highest defect-yield per line of policy
text, and that can be mechanically checked with tools already verified on
this machine:

| # | Rule | Source | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | All source files compile without errors | Zephyr Rule 2 / MISRA Dir 2.1 | ESP-IDF default `-Werror` |
| 2 | All `psa_*`/`mbedtls_*` return values are tested | Zephyr Rule 9 / MISRA Dir 4.7 / CERT ERR33-C | Manual code review + `grep -nE '^\s*psa_[a-z]+\(' src/*.c` in CI |
| 3 | No dynamic memory allocation in any PBFT hot-path function | Zephyr Rule 14 / MISRA Dir 4.12 / CERT API03-C | `cppcheck --addon=cert --enable=warning` flags every `malloc/calloc/realloc/free` call |
| 4 | No `malloc`/`calloc`/`realloc` calls in any `.c` file | MISRA Rule 21.3, Zephyr Rule 123 | `grep -nE '\b(malloc|calloc|realloc|free)\s*\(' src/*.c` must return 0 hits (in CI) |
| 5 | All functions have explicit prototypes | MISRA Rule 8.2 / 8.6 / 8.10 | `-Wmissing-prototypes -Wstrict-prototypes` (in §4.2) |
| 6 | No use of `<stdio.h>`, `<setjmp.h>`, `<tgmath.h>` | Zephyr Rule 125-129 | `grep -nE '#include\s*<(stdio\|setjmp\|tgmath)\.h>' src/*.c include/*.h` must return 0 |
| 7 | No octal constants | MISRA Rule 7.1, Zephyr Rule 39 | `grep -nE '\b0[0-7]+\b' src/*.c \| grep -v '// '` should match only intentional ones |
| 8 | No implicit fallthrough in `switch` statements | MISRA Rule 16.3, Zephyr Rule 92 | `-Werror=implicit-fallthrough=5` (in §4.2) |
| 9 | All string buffers are `len + 1` bytes | CERT STR31-C | Manual review; `-Wstringop-overflow=2` catches most cases |
| 10 | `-fanalyzer` reports no issues on a clean build | Linux kernel + GCC 15 docs | Build with `-fanalyzer`; fail on any `-Wanalyzer-*` warning |

**Activation cost:** one CI workflow (≤30 lines YAML) + adding the flags
from §4.2 to `esp-pbft/CMakeLists.txt`. Total: ~2 hours of setup, ongoing
overhead of ~30% build time on the esp-pbft component.
